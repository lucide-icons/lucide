// This file is make sure that we can import from "lucide-react/dynamic" without having to specify the extension. This is a workaround for the fact that some bundlers (like Webpack) don't support importing from "lucide-react/dynamic.mjs" without specifying the extension.
// Unfortunately, we can't use exports field in package.json because it breaks some runtime environments. See https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide/issues/2743#issuecomment-2626784300
// eslint-disable-next-line import/no-unresolved
export * from './dynamic.mjs';
