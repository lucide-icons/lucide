## What is Lucide?

Lucide is a community-run fork of [Feather Icons](https://github.com/feathericons/feather), open for anyone to contribute icons.
Started after growing disaffection of the moderation of the [Feather Icons](https://github.com/feathericons/feather) project, with over 300+ open issues and over 100+ open PRs, this project is no longer maintained. The owner of the project stopped merging icons and want to keep the project like it now is. Hundreds of developers/designer wasted their time trying to contribute, what a shame.

We're trying to expanding the icon set as much as possible while keeping it nice-looking, we do it as a community of devs and designers, join us!

### Why choose Lucide over Feather Icons

- Lucide already expended the icon set by 130+ in less then a year, so more icons to work with.
- Well maintained code base.
- Active community.

## Usage

At its core, Lucide is a collection of [SVG](https://svgontheweb.com/#svg) files. This means that you can use Feather icons in all the same ways you can use SVGs (e.g. `img`, `background-image`, `inline`, `object`, `embed`, `iframe`). Here's a helpful article detailing the many ways SVGs can be used on the web: [SVG on the Web â€“ Implementation Options](https://svgontheweb.com/#implementation)

With the Javascript library you can easily incorporate the icon you want in your webpage.
