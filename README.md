## Usage

At its core, Featherity is a collection of [SVG](https://svgontheweb.com/#svg) files. This means that you can use Feather icons in all the same ways you can use SVGs (e.g. `img`, `background-image`, `inline`, `object`, `embed`, `iframe`). Here's a helpful article detailing the many ways SVGs can be used on the web: [SVG on the Web – Implementation Options](https://svgontheweb.com/#implementation)
