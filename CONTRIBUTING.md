# Contribution Guidelines

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Lucide. Feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Pull Requests

Feel free to open a pull-request to contribute to this project.

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

Guidelines for pull requests:
- __Make your commit messages as descriptive as possible.__ Include as much information as you can. Explain anything that the file diffs themselves wonâ€™t make apparent.
- __Document your pull request__. Explain your fix, link to the relevant issue, add screenshots when adding new icons.
- __Make sure the target of your pull request is the relevant branch__. Most of bugfix or new feature should go to the `master` branch.
- __Include only related work__. If your pull request has unrelated commit, it won't be accepted.

## Icon Requests

Before creating an icon request, please search to see if someone has requested the icon already. If there is an open request, please add a :+1:.

If the icon has not already been requested, [create an issue](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide/issues/new?title=Icon%20Request:) with a title of `Icon request: <icon name>` and add as much information as possible.

## Icon Requests from Feather
If you are a designer who wants to contribute to Lucide but you don't know what icons to work on, then have a look at the Requests from Feather. All open, unfinished and valid requests can be found in [Feather Icon Requests](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide/issues/119).
