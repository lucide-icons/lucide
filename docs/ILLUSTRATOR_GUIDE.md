# Illustrator Template Guide

This Guide explains how to properly use the Adobe Illustrator Template for Lucide. 
>Attention: Even though it is unlikely the template can be outdated or not 100% correct. Please check the Icon Design Guide before you start working with the template to ensure integrity with the Lucide icon pack.
  
## General Workflow

The Illustrator template is created following guidelines from the [Icon Design Guide](ICON_DESIGN_GUIDE.md). 
  
**Workflow:**
1. Open the Document which can be found under __*/docs/templates/illustrator_template.ai*__ .

2. You can now remove the content from the example logo layer ("Draw") and start creating.

3. Verify that you follow the [Icon Design Guidelines](ICON_DESIGN_GUIDE.md).

4. When you are ready to export the file as an SVG make sure to check that you followed the guidelines and remove all unecessary layers (especially "Padding" and "Grid").

5. Double check that the [code conventions and SVG global attributes](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide/blob/master/docs/ICON_DESIGN_GUIDE.md#code-conventions) are correct.

6. Minify paths with [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/).
