# Introduction

An open source icon library for displaying icons and symbols in digital and non digital projects. It is containing over 500+ Vector (svg) files. To use these icons, lucide provides several official packages to make it easier to use these icons in projects.

Lucide contains icons with different variants and states. With that designers and developers can choose the right icon for them selves. If icons don't exist you're free to open design request. The Lucide community will help.

With help of the community, contributors are providing the library of new icons. With more icons, we simply have more icons to work with in your project. Also with rising of new applications with specific features lucide has the goal the provide the complete set for you project.

When designing new icons, the community is working with a set of design rules. This is to keep icons: recognizable, consistency in style, and readable on all sizes. The community likes to have creativity in new icons but conventional design is important to have recognizable icons.

Beside design, code is also important. Assets like icons in for example web projects can increase the transferred bytes significantly. With the growing internet, lucide has the responsibility to keep their assets small as possible. To achieve this, lucide uses SVG compression and specific code architecture for tree-shaking abilities. With tree-shaking used you will only ship the icons you used, helps you to keep the software small as possible when distributed.
