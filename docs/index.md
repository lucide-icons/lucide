# Introduction

## What is Lucide?

Lucide is a community-run fork of [Feather Icons](https://github.com/feathericons/feather), open for anyone to contribute icons.

It began after growing disaffection of the [Feather Icons](https://github.com/feathericons/feather) project moderation. With over 300+ open issues and over 100+ open PRs, the Feather Icons project has been abandoned. This unfortunately means that hundreds of developers and designers wasted their time contributing to Feather Icons with no chance of PRs being accepted.

Lucide is trying to expand the icon set as much as possible while staying faithful to the original simplistic design language. We do this as a community of devs and designers and hope that you'll join us!

### Why choose Lucide over Feather Icons

- Lucide already expended the icon set by 130+ in less then a year, so more icons to work with.
- Well maintained code base.
- Active community.

## Getting Started

At its core, Lucide is a collection of [SVG](https://svgontheweb.com/#svg) files. This means that you can use Lucide icons in all the same ways you can use SVGs (e.g. `img`, `background-image`, `inline`, `object`, `embed`, `iframe`). Here's a helpful article detailing the many ways SVGs can be used on the web: [SVG on the Web â€“ Implementation Options](https://svgontheweb.com/#implementation)
