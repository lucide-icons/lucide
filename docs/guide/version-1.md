# Lucide version 1

:::warning
STILL WORK IN PROGRESS, some guides and docs are not finished yet.
:::

After years of work and dedication, Lucide version 1 has been officially **released**! This milestone marks a significant achievement in our journey to provide a comprehensive and versatile icon library for developers and designers alike.

It's been crazy especially the last year, Lucide went over 20 million downloads per week and is used by million of projects worldwide. This release is a testament to the hard work of our community and contributors who have helped shape Lucide into what it is today.

Thank you to everyone who has supported us along the way. We couldn't have done it without you!

## Removed All Brand Icons

As part of our commitment to maintaining a sustainable and legally compliant icon library, we have made the decision to remove all brand icons from Lucide version 1. This change is in response to increasing legal pressures and the complexities associated with trademarked brand icons. See our [brand logo statement](/brand-logo-statement) for more details.

We understand that brand icons are important to many of our users, and we want to assure you that this decision was not made lightly. Our primary goal is to ensure that Lucide remains a reliable and legally sound resource for the community.

For users who still require brand icons, we recommend [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/), which provides an extensive, legally safer collection of brand logos.

## Improved documentation, guides per framework.

We have revamped our documentation to provide clearer, more comprehensive guides tailored to each supported framework. Whether you're using React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Angular, Astro or Vanilla JavaScript, you'll find: step-by-step instructions, code example and best practices to help you integrate Lucide seamlessly into your projects.

## Enhanced performance and accessibility.
